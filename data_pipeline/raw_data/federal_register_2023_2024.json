Specifically, HUD is extending the compliance date for the HOME Investment Partnerships program (HOME), HOME-American Rescue Plan program, Housing Trust Fund (HTF), Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA), Community Development Block Grant program (CDBG), Emergency Solution Grants (ESG), Continuum of Care (CoC) programs, and CPD programs funded through competitive processes (Competitive Programs). HUD is extending the compliance deadline for all grantees and allowing grantees that are ready to comply to set an earlier compliance date between January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2026. In addition, HUD is permitting the implementation of certain income safe harbors established in the HOTMA final rule prior to the extended HOTMA compliance date. HUD is taking this action due to delays in updating the HUD systems to comply with HOTMA and to allow additional time for jurisdictions, participants, and grantees to incorporate HUD's income and asset requirements into their own programs and flexibility to transition implementing HOTMA requirements under their own timelines.",

The application also includes approximately 44,670.87 acres of non- Federal lands that would be subject to the withdrawal if they are subsequently acquired by the United States. The purpose of the withdrawal would be to preserve the scenic values, recreational opportunities, outdoor economy, rare wildlife and plant habitat, and cultural resources that the Ruby Mountains and neighboring spaces support. The lands would remain open to location and entry under the U.S. mining laws, and subject to mineral material disposal under the Materials Act of 1947. Publication of this notice temporarily segregates the lands for up to 2 years, initiates a 90-day public comment period, and announces to the public an opportunity to comment and participate in a virtual public meeting on the USFS' withdrawal application.",

We propose to codify US SHIP as a Federal regulatory program and allow participating sites to obtain certifications of disease-monitored status for African swine fever and classical swine fever. Establishment of US SHIP would allow participating sites to market their products with the relevant certification status, which could limit disruptions to international and interstate commerce during outbreaks.",

Specifically, we are requiring commercial poultry premises to successfully pass a biosecurity audit prior to restocking if they were previously HPAI-infected and wish to be eligible for indemnity for the restocked poultry. We are also requiring a biosecurity audit for commercial poultry premises in the buffer zone prior to movement of poultry onto the premises, if the premises wishes to be eligible for indemnity for the poultry moved onto the premises. We are also revising the regulations to preclude indemnity payments for poultry moved onto premises in infected zones if the poultry become infected with HPAI within 14 days following the dissolution of the control area in which the infected zone is located. This action is necessary on an immediate basis in order to ensure that commercial poultry producers who receive indemnity payments for HPAI are taking measures to preclude the introduction and spread of HPAI, and avoiding actions that contribute to its spread. This action amends the regulations to condition indemnity for HPAI accordingly.",

This proposed AD was prompted by a report of corrosion and cracks on the broadband antenna adapter plate during an inspection. This proposed AD would require repetitive general visual inspections (GVI) of the broadband antenna adapter plate, skirt, vents, and attachment fittings and limit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

The determination must be based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review.

As required by TSCA, EPA established fees to defray a portion of the costs associated with administering certain provisions of TSCA. The comment period provides an opportunity for the public to provide comments, self-identify, or correct errors on the preliminary lists. In addition, manufacturers (including importers) are required to self-identify as a manufacturer (or importer) of one or more the five identified High-Priority Substances irrespective of whether they are included on the preliminary lists, and may use this period to do so. Where appropriate, entities may also avoid or reduce fee obligations by making certain certifications consistent with the TSCA Fees Rule. EPA expects to publish final lists of manufacturers (including importers) subject to fees no later than concurrently with the publication of the final scope documents for risk evaluations of these five High-Priority Substances. Manufacturers (including importers) identified on the final lists will be subject to the applicable fees.",

The proposed amendments would implement the guidance and update cross-references to OMB provisions that have been renumbered or reorganized. HUD is also proposing changes to improve some grant management and administrative program regulations based on HUD's experience implementing OMB's regulations and guidance in existing entitlement, discretionary, and other programs involving grant management and administration. Finally, HUD is proposing changes to its Title VI, Section 108, Section 184, and Section 184A loan guarantee program regulations to address OMB's changes for loan guarantee programs regarding System for Award Management (SAM.gov) registration and to clarify that the Section 184 and Section 184A programs are subject to audit requirements in OMB's regulations and final guidance. All these changes will improve HUD's processes for awarding Federal financial assistance and align HUD's regulations with governmentwide efforts to adopt consistent and standardized terms and data elements, implement data- and risk-based frameworks, reduce Federal agency and recipient burdens, promote consistent interpretations of OMB's regulations and guidance, and improve and maximize agencies' ability to assess performance of recipients.",

The proposed updates specifically relate to recommendations for Screening and Counseling for Intimate Partner and Domestic Violence, Breast Cancer Screening for Women at Average Risk, and Patient Navigation Services for Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening. Recommendations to update the Guidelines are developed by the Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI) for consideration by HRSA. WPSI convenes expert health professionals to conduct rigorous reviews of the evidence following the National Academy of Medicine standards for establishing foundations for and rating strengths of recommendations, articulation of recommendations, and external reviews and it develops draft recommendations for HRSA's consideration. After consideration of public comment, HRSA has accepted the recommendations as revised and detailed in this notice. Under applicable law, non- grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group and individual health insurance coverage must include coverage, without cost sharing, for certain preventive services, including those provided for in the HRSA-supported Guidelines. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury have previously issued regulations describing how group health plans and health insurance issuers apply the coverage requirements.

The FAA finds this action necessary to address significant, unacceptable safety-of-flight risks to U.S. civil aviation operations in the specified areas of the Sanaa FIR (OYSC) stemming from heightened regional tensions associated with Houthi weapons employment and operational activities. Most recently, Houthi forces have engaged in increased weapons employment and operational activities related to the Israel-Gaza Conflict, leading in some cases to air defense responses. The FAA also takes into account the Houthis' recent history of having conducted long-range attacks emanating from the Sanaa FIR (OYSC) in other directions, notably against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2022. The FAA also republishes the approval process and exemption information for this Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR), consistent with other recently published flight prohibition SFARs.",

Through the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act, which became law on February 6, 2020, Congress extended the temporary control of fentanyl-related substances until May 6, 2021. This temporary order was subsequently extended multiple times, most recently on December 29, 2022, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which extended the order until December 31, 2024.

The guidance provides a comprehensive and systematic approach to pediatric extrapolation during drug development. Notably, the guidance discusses approaches to safety extrapolation and defining extrapolation as a continuum. The guidance also includes approaches to study designs and statistical methodologies, including modeling and simulation, for developing and implementing pediatric extrapolation. The guidance is intended to provide approaches that can increase the efficiency of pediatric drug development and accelerate the availability of safe and effective drugs approved for use in children. The guidance replaces the draft guidance \"E11A Pediatric Exploration\" issued on August 29, 2022.",

Under the Energy Conservation and Production Act, as amended (ECPA), upon publication of an affirmative determination, each State must review the energy efficiency provisions of its residential building code and determine whether it is appropriate for such state to revise its building code to meet or exceed the 2024 IECC. Additionally, this notification provides guidance on state code review processes and associated certifications.",

If approved, the amendment would add a condition to the NSS license reflecting the NRC's approval of the LTP and establishing criteria for determining when changes to the LTP require prior NRC approval. The NRC staff has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for this proposed license amendment in accordance with NRC regulations. Based on the EA, the NRC has concluded that a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) is appropriate. Therefore, in accordance with NRC regulations, preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) is not warranted for the proposed action. The NRC staff also is conducting a safety evaluation of the proposed license amendment.",

This Consortium aims to unite Federal and State agencies, academia, business, and industry to enhance robust transparency, accuracy, reliability, and interoperability of methane plume detection and quantification data products. In this evolving field of measurement and analysis, consistency across products and results, an understanding of the drivers of error, and a well- constructed validation strategy, are important to increase trust in the data products. To achieve this, the Consortium is focused on identifying the strengths and limitations of current methodologies and analysis approaches. The Consortium seeks to foster transparency through improved documentation, consensus building around best practices and the development of documentary consensus standards. In addition, the Consortium seeks to support the coordination and standardization of validation approaches for these measurements and the utilization of controlled releases. By fostering collaboration among business, Federal agencies, local governmental stakeholders, and researchers, the Consortium aims to drive advancements in methane plume detection and quantification and the analysis supported by them. Participants will be required to sign a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA).",

In July 2024, HUD convened an insurance summit to address challenges in the property insurance market. The insurance summit highlighted the need to increase property resilience to natural hazards and to clarify the relationship between resilience measures and costs to property owners, including the cost of insurance. Through this Request for Information (RFI), HUD seeks public input regarding how best to assess measures to increase the resilience of residential properties to natural hazards and extreme weather. This information will allow HUD to develop policies that better support HUD's program participants in increasing resilience to natural hazards, including extreme weather, and accessing affordable insurance for their properties.",

The proposed rates will address UGP operating changes and new provisions and settlement requirements under the proposed revisions to SPP's Tariff filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to accommodate their RTO expansion into the Western Interconnection.

Through the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act, which became law on February 6, 2020, Congress extended the temporary control of fentanyl-related substances until May 6, 2021. This temporary order was subsequently extended multiple times, most recently on December 29, 2022, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which extended the order until December 31, 2024. If finalized, this action would make permanent the existing regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, import, export, engage in research, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis, or possess), or propose to handle these seven specific controlled substances.",

The EPA's draft analyses show that the values developed under these statutes are similarly protective of aquatic life and that the most sensitive OPP aquatic life benchmarks, which are updated regularly to include the latest science, could also serve as CWA section 304(a)(1) recommended aquatic life criteria or 304(a)(2) informational benchmarks for pesticides.

The flightcrew might follow misleading flight director (F/D) guidance after disconnecting the autopilot, without reference to the other available information and flight deck indications. This proposed AD would require installing new autopilot flight director computer (AFDC) operational program software (OPS) and doing a software configuration check.

    "abstract": "The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA or the Agency) publishes its decision to deny an application from Waymo LLC (Waymo, USDOT #3000336) and Aurora Operations, Inc. (Aurora, USDOT #3441156) (together, Applicants), requesting an exemption from certain Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) related to requirements to place specific types of warning devices at prescribed locations around commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) stopped on the traveled portion or shoulder of a highway for any cause other than necessary traffic stops and requirements that lamps on CMVs be steady burning. Applicants requested that they and \"other similarly situated companies\" be permitted to instead use \"Cab-Mounted Warning Beacons\" (including \"variants\" and \"any configuration of similar effectiveness\") when the CMV is operated by a Level 4 Automated Driving System (ADS) either without a human on board or with a human on board when testing the warning beacons. Safety is FMCSA's highest priority. The Agency embraces USDOT's Innovation Principles, including adapting as technology changes and supporting technologies that further our policy goals. While the application and the public comments show promise for alternative warning devices to provide safety benefits for warning motorists of a stopped CMV under certain conditions, the present application does not demonstrate how Applicants or other proposed exempted parties would ensure an equivalent or greater level of safety than would be achieved absent the exemption. The application does not provide sufficient details about proposed alternative devices, and the limited data presented does not support a likely equivalent level of safety for a national, industry-wide exemption for all companies operating autonomous CMVs. If Applicants can reasonably address the reasons for the denial, Applicants may resubmit an exemption application.",

The amendments require electronic filers (\"filers\") to authorize and maintain designated individuals as account administrators and to take certain actions, through their account administrators, to manage their accounts on EDGAR. Further, pursuant to these amendments, filers may only authorize individuals as account administrators or in the other roles described herein if those individuals first obtain individual account credentials in the manner specified in the EDGAR Filer Manual. As part of the EDGAR Next changes, optional Application Programming Interfaces (\"APIs\") will be offered to filers for machine-to-machine communication with EDGAR. Moreover, we are amending Volume I of the EDGAR Filer Manual to accord with these changes. Filers will have 12 months from the issuance of this release to transition to EDGAR Next.",

The EPA is proposing decisions resulting from the Agency's technology review of the PEPO NESHAP and decisions based on its reconsideration of certain issues raised in an administrative petition for reconsideration. Furthermore, the EPA is proposing to strengthen the emission standards for ethylene oxide (EtO) emissions after considering the results of a risk assessment for the PEPO NESHAP. The EPA is also proposing to require performance testing once every 5 years, to add work practice standards for certain activities where alternatives are appropriate, and to add provisions for electronic reporting. We estimate that the proposed amendments to the PEPO NESHAP, excluding the EtO emission standards, would reduce hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from PEPO sources by approximately 157 tons per year (tpy). Additionally, the proposed EtO emission standards are expected to reduce EtO emissions by approximately 14 tpy. We also estimate that these proposed amendments to the NESHAP will reduce excess emissions of HAP from flares in the PEPO Production source category by an additional 75 tpy.",

On August 12, 2024, Plaintiff Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California San Francisco Division, alleging that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) failed to perform certain non-discretionary duties in accordance with the Act to take final action on a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of California. EPA is providing notice of this proposed consent decree, which would resolve all claims in the case by establishing a deadline for EPA to take final action as specified in the decree.",

AD 2016-14-04 also requires sealing the main cabin floor areas above the aft EE bay, installing drip shields and foam blocks, and rerouting the wire bundles near the drip shields above the equipment in the aft EE bay. Since the FAA issued AD 2016-14- 04, it was determined that sealant, moisture barrier tape and tape dam requirements above the EE bays may not have been installed on production airplanes. This proposed AD continues to require the actions in AD 2016-14-04 and would require an inspection of seat tracks above the EE bays for missing, damaged, or deteriorated sealant, moisture barrier tape, or tape dams, as applicable, and applicable on-condition actions. This proposed AD also adds airplanes to the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

The final rule also requires that newly appointed members of the board of directors have a working familiarity with the succession plan no later than six months after appointment. The final rule follows publication of a July 25, 2024, proposed rule and takes into consideration the public comments received on the proposed rule. In response to comments, the Board has amended the proposal to provide that a credit union board must review its succession plan no less than every 24 months, as opposed to the annual review that would have been required under the proposed rule. The Board has also revised the proposed rule by removing loan officers, credit committee members, and supervisory committee members from the list of FICU officials that must be covered by the succession plans. In addition, non-substantive changes have been made to the wording used in the list of covered officials for purposes of clarity. The final rule also streamlines the required contents of the succession plans and no longer requires that deviations from approved succession plans be documented in the FICU board's meeting minutes. Further, to help ensure that FICUs have the necessary time to develop their succession plans, the Board is delaying the effective date of the final rule until January 1, 2026.",

In a February 6, 2024, order, the Fourth Circuit granted a voluntary remand of the final rule to the Department of Energy (\"DOE\") to determine whether establishment of the test procedure for the thermal efficiency two (\"TE2\") metric is supported by the specific provisions applicable to CWAFs under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (\"EPCA\"). More specifically, DOE agreed in this voluntary remand to only establish the TE2 test procedure if the Department makes a determination that the TE2 test procedure is consistent with the amended industry test procedure, or a determination, supported by clear and convincing evidence, that the amended industry test procedure fails to satisfy the statutory requirements. This document provides DOE's tentative determination that the amended industry test procedure fails to satisfy EPCA's statutory requirements and requests comment on this topic.",

In each circumstance, motor carriers are required to rate the performance of the driver during the test on a road test form provided by the motor carrier.

The Agency's review found that Mosaic's request is complete per the requirements of EPA's National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants under the Clean Air Act, and that the potential radiological risks from conducting the pilot project meet the regulatory requirement that the project is at least as protective of public health as maintaining the phosphogypsum in a stack. On October 9, 2024, the EPA issued a pending approval of the request and solicited public comments on the pending approval. While EPA received comments raising questions about the project, no comments were received which led EPA to change the results of its risk analyses for this proposed pilot project.

    "abstract": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) has decided not to proceed with the development of a regulation addressing the manufacture, processing, or distribution in commerce of lead for wheel-balancing weights (\"lead wheel weights\") under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). This action relates to a citizen petition filed with the Agency in 2009 (\"2009 petition\"). The 2009 petition, which EPA granted, asked EPA to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to regulate the manufacturing, processing, or distribution in commerce of lead wheel weights. In 2023, the same parties filed a petition for a writ of mandamus (\"mandamus petition\") that sought to compel EPA to initiate the rulemaking proceeding requested in the 2009 petition. After reviewing the information submitted in response to an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) issued in April 2024 and EPA's technical analysis thereof, EPA has decided not to proceed with the development of a proposed rule. Addressing potential remaining exposures from lead continues to be a high priority for EPA, as reflected in EPA's announcement that \"Lead and Lead Compounds\" is on its list of candidate chemical substances currently being considered for future prioritization actions under TSCA.",

The Study is composed of a summary report and four appendices containing three coordinated modeled analyses and a qualitative literature review. The Study materials are available on the DOE/FECM website at https:// www.energy.gov/fecm/regulation. DOE intends to use the Study to inform its public interest review of, and ultimately decisions in, certain applications to export LNG to countries with which the United States does not have a free trade agreement (FTA) requiring national treatment for trade in natural gas and with which trade is not prohibited by U.S. law or policy (non-FTA applications), including decisions in the above- referenced proceedings and future proceedings, and for other purposes. DOE invites the submission of comments regarding the Study. DOE does not intend to revise the Study upon receipt of comments. Rather, comments received will inform DOE's public interest determination in each of the above-listed non-FTA application proceedings and future non-FTA export proceedings. Comments submitted in compliance with the instructions in this Notice will be placed in the administrative record for all of the above-listed proceedings and need only be submitted once.",

The regulation for which exemption is sought covers emergency core cooling systems (ECCS) for light-water nuclear power reactors. Staff review of the U.S. EPR standard design certification application was suspended in April 2015 at the request of the applicant. Framatome committed to submit the required report before any request to reactivate the U.S. EPR review. Framatome further committed to providing an update to the required report, or taking other appropriate action, as necessary, no later than December 31, 2028. The NRC staff reviewed this request and determined that it is appropriate to grant the exemption in accordance with the regulations as the request does not present an undue risk to public health or safety and is consistent with the common defense and security; furthermore, special circumstances exist.",
