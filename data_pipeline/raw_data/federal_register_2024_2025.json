AD 2020-06-18 requires replacement of affected trimmable horizontal stabilizer actuators (THSAs) with serviceable THSAs. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-06-18, a new Airbus airplane model (A321-253NY) has been certified, on which affected parts could be installed in service. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-06-18, would revise the applicability to include Model A321-253NY airplanes, and would prohibit the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

This document describes a collection of information for which NHTSA intends to seek a revision to an OMB-approved collection titled \"Drivers' Use of Camera-Based Rear Visibility Systems Versus Traditional Mirrors\" identified by OMB Control Number 2127-0756. The collection is currently approved through July 31, 2025, and supports research addressing safety-related aspects of drivers' use of camera-based rear visibility systems designed to replace or supplement vehicle rearview mirrors. This collection is necessary to inform next steps on an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) NHTSA published in response to two petitions requesting revision of FMVSS No. 111 to permit such camera- based systems as an alternative compliance option for certain current requirements specifying rearview mirrors.

The fishery management measures include fishing areas, seasons, quotas, legal gear, recreational fishing days and catch limits, harvest guidelines, possession and landing restrictions, and minimum lengths for salmon taken in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off Washington, Oregon, and California. These measures are intended to prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from the fishery, to provide for the exercise of federally recognized fishing rights by West Coast Indian Tribes, to allow a portion of the salmon runs to escape the ocean fisheries in order to provide for spawning escapement, and to apportion the ocean harvest equitably among non-Indian commercial and recreational fisheries.",

The two settlement agreements concern the Mohawk Tannery Site in Nashua, New Hampshire. The Blaylock Modified PPA and the Greenfield PPA are entered into pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (\"CERCLA,\" also known as the Superfund law), and the authority of the Attorney General of the United States to compromise and settle claims of the United States. The proposed Blaylock Modified BFPPA is between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and bona fide prospective purchaser Blaylock Holdings, LLC. The proposed Blaylock Modified BFPPA requires that Blaylock conduct work under EPA oversight in exchange for a covenant not to sue pursuant to sections 106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9606 and 9607(a) for existing contamination at the Mohawk Tannery Site. The Blaylock Modified BFPPA provides pre- authorized mixed funding for the work. Under the Greenfield PPA, Greenfield has an agreement to assume long-term ownership duties and to perform post-removal site controls in connection with approximately 4 acres of property (the \"Containment Parcel\") located in Nashua, New Hampshire, which is a part of the Mohawk Tannery Site as set forth in the Blaylock Modified BFPPA, EPA Region 1 CERCLA Docket No. 01-2024- 0056 pertaining to the Site and the Containment Parcel, which is a portion of the Site. Blaylock and Greenfield consent to and will not contest the authority of the United States to enter into the Blaylock Modified BFPPA and the Greenfield PPA, or to implement or enforce their respective terms. Blaylock and Greenfield recognize that these settlement agreements have been negotiated in good faith and that the Blaylock Modified BFPPA and Greenfield PPA are entered into without the admission or adjudication of any issue of fact or law.",

Since the FAA issued AD 2022-15-05, additional cracks have been found at the door stop fitting number 1 holes at frame (FR) 68, after disassembly of the door stop fitting as part of the inspections required by AD 2022-15-05. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-15-05, but with reduced compliances times for some inspections, and would require an additional inspection at door stop fitting number 1, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference.

Specifically, TerraPower, on behalf of USO, requested an exemption that would modify a portion of the definition of construction applicable to the prohibition of construction of production and utilization facilities without an NRC license for the proposed Kemmerer 1. This exemption modifies the definition for the proposed Kemmerer 1 and allows the driving of piles, subsurface preparation, placement of backfill, concrete, or permanent retaining walls within an excavation, installation of foundations, or the in- place assembly, erection, fabrication or testing, which are for structures, systems, and components classified as non-safety-related with no special treatment (NST); the failure of which could cause a reactor scram or actuation of a safety-related system that is located on the proposed energy island prior to receipt of a construction permit and without a limited work authorization.",

These actions will open or expand 42 opportunities for hunting and fishing across more than 87,000 acres of Service lands and waters. In addition, at the request of the State of Minnesota and the White Earth Nation, Tamarac NWR proposes to end an experimental 5-day early teal hunt where the refuge overlaps with Tribal land to ensure safety for wild rice harvesting and to align with State regulations. We also propose to make administrative changes to existing station-specific regulations to improve the clarity and accuracy of regulations, reduce the regulatory burden on the public, and comply with a Presidential mandate for plain- language standards.",

The test is designed to ensure, as required by statute, that non-uniform or non-broad -based health care-related taxes, authorized under a waiver, are generally redistributive. The inadvertent loophole currently allows some health care-related taxes, especially taxes on managed care organizations, to be imposed at higher tax rates on Medicaid taxable units than non-Medicaid taxable units, contrary to statutory and regulatory intent for health care-related taxes to be generally redistributive. The proposed provisions would better implement the statutory requirements by adding additional safeguards to ensure that tax waivers that exploit the loophole because they pass the current statistical test, but are not generally redistributive, are not approvable.",

AD 2017-23-04 requires an inspection of the upper wing skin and top stringer joints, and modification of the stringer joint couplings if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-23-04, it has been determined that additional airplanes may be subject to the identified unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2017-23-04 and would add airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also remove certain airplanes from the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

As promulgated in October 2023, the regulation requires manufacturers (including importers) of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in any year between 2011-2022 to report certain data to EPA related to exposure and environmental and health effects. This change is necessary because EPA requires more time to prepare the reporting application to collect this data. The Agency is separately considering reopening certain aspects of the rule to public comment. The delayed reporting date ensures that EPA has adequate time to consider the public comments and propose and finalize any modifications to the rule before the submission period begins.",

The revisions were submitted in part to respond to the EPA's June 12, 2015 \"SIP call\" in which the EPA found a provision in the Washington SIP applicable in the area regulated by SWCAA to be substantially inadequate, providing affirmative defenses that operate to limit the jurisdiction of the Federal court in an enforcement action related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. The EPA's approval of the SIP revisions to the substantially inadequate provision corrects the SWCAA deficiency identified in the 2015 SSM SIP call and the EPA's January 2022 finding of failure to submit. Washington withdrew some portions of the revisions submitted that were not identified in the 2015 SSM SIP call and therefore the EPA is not approving those withdrawn portions. The EPA proposed to approve this action on December 10, 2024, and received no comments.",

The applicant requested this authorization for take by harassment that may result from activities associated with pile driving and marine construction activities in Near Island Channel in Kodiak, Alaska. We estimate that this project may result in the nonlethal incidental take by harassment of up to 460 northern sea otters from the Southwest Alaska stock. This proposed authorization, if finalized, will be for up to 3,160 takes of 460 northern sea otters by Level B harassment. No take by Level A harassment or lethal take are requested, or expected, and no such take will be authorized.",

Since the FAA issued AD 2021-09-14, Airbus has developed modifications to the components of the MGB fan bearing assembly and issued new material regarding these modifications. This AD retains the actions required by AD 2021-09-14 and also requires installing the improved MGB fan rotor bearing assembly, which constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspections. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
